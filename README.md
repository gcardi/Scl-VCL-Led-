# Scl-VCL-Led-
A scalable VCL Led Control (component)

The LED is rendered using GDI+ with antialiasing. It has several properties to control the aspect:

 - The bool property "State" for on/off.
 - A TColor property named "TrueColor" to control the color when the led state is "on".
 - A TColor property named "FalseColor" to control the color the when the led state is "off".
 - A TColor property RingColor for the color of the outer ring.
 - A float property RingSizePercent to control the thickness of the outer ring respect the external led's diameter.

The led shine is drawn using a closed path defined using bezier lines aimed to color an irregular area with a gradient with alpha blending.
